### Filter on invalid SSL transactions & enrich new data stream
The ```SSL``` topic from Zeek has information about the TCP connection in SSL/TLS exchanges, and the ```x509``` topic from Zeek has data about the certificate itself.

Join these two data sources to create a derived data stream with IP addresses and ports but also Certificate Authority, certificate creation and expiration information. Enrich this data stream with Geo IP information as well as network ownership via ASN records.
- Create a stream from the ```ssl``` topic
```sql
CREATE STREAM ssl_stream ( 
ts DOUBLE(16,6), 
uid STRING, 
"id.orig_h" VARCHAR, 
"id.orig_p" INTEGER, 
"id.resp_h" VARCHAR, 
"id.resp_p" INTEGER, 
version STRING, 
cipher VARCHAR, 
curve STRING, 
server_name VARCHAR, 
resumed BOOLEAN, 
next_protocol VARCHAR, 
established BOOLEAN, 
cert_chain_fuids ARRAY<STRING>, 
client_cert_chain_fuids ARRAY<STRING>, 
subject VARCHAR, 
issuer VARCHAR, 
validation_status STRING) 
WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='ssl', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');
```

- Do the same for the ```x509``` topic
```sql
CREATE STREAM x509_stream ( 
ts DOUBLE(16,6), 
id STRING, 
"certificate.version" INTEGER, 
"certificate.serial" STRING, 
"certificate.subject" VARCHAR, 
"certificate.issuer" VARCHAR, 
"certificate.not_valid_before" BIGINT, 
"certificate.not_valid_after" BIGINT, 
"certificate.key_alg" STRING, 
"certificate.sig_alg" STRING, 
"certificate.key_type" STRING, 
"certificate.key_length" INTEGER, 
"certificate.exponent" INTEGER, 
"basic_constraints.ca" BOOLEAN, 
"basic_constraints.path_len" INTEGER) 
WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='x509', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');
```
- Format a new field called ```EVENT_TIME``` by transforming the SSL event's timestamp
- Enrich the data with the ```GETGEOFORIP``` and ```GETASNFORIP``` User Defined Functions
- Join the ```SSL_STREAM``` with the ```X509_STREAM``` where the certificate subjects match.  
```sql

s.TS AS SSL_TS,

- Create a new stream with only these groomed events.  This will also create a new topic, which can be consumed by any number of different downstream connectors simultaneously.
